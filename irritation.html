    <h1>Hi. I made this website to be as irritating as possible.</h1>

    <p>So, I wanted to make a website. But I felt like modern websites are missing something; they have so much potential at being annoying. Unfortunately, companies don't want their reputation ruined, so they'll never incorporate anything like it. It's honestly a shame. So, I decided I would pick up the task, and this is the result!</p>

    <div class="hidden-text">If you've found this, congratulations. No idea how you did it, but props to you.</div>

    <div class="popup">So anyway, let's get the important stuff out of the way. Do you want to accept or reject all the cookies? What about ads. Do you like ads? Can we track you? Steal your data?</div>

    <a href="index.html" class="escape">Help! Go back!</a>

    <div class="unreachable-button"><a href="index.html">Good luck.</a></div>

    <div class="horrible-textbox">Disclaimer: contrary to the popup, this website collects none of your data, and it's just for fun.</div>

    <div class="angry-button"></div>
